# ff-shortcuts-rs

Finding what extensions have keymaps and finding conflicts is cumbersome, to say the least.

Once you do, you see every possible command you _could_ map to a key rather than just the ones that are mapped. You also dont see the builtin keymaps which also makes finding available maps annoying.

I want a cheatsheet that puts everything in one place.


```bash
cargo run
firefox output.html
```
Done.
